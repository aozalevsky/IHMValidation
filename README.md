IHMValidation is a software pipeline that follows guidelines and recommendations from IHM TaskForce [(Berman et al. 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31780431/) for assesment of integrative biomolecular structures. The current version of the PDB-IHM validation report consists of six categories, (i) overview, (ii) model details, (ii) data quality assessments, (iv) model quality assessments, and (v) fit to data used to build the model. A sixth category, fit to data used to validate the model is under development. Data quality assessments and fit to data used for modeling categories are dependent on the different types of experimental data used in integrative modeling. We are breaking down this section based on experimental data type and addressing each method separately. The current version of the validation report is focused on validating models built using Small Angle Scattering (SAS), Chemical Crosslinking Mass Spectrometry (crosslinking-MS), and 3D Electron Microscopy (3DEM) data and is based on the model and data validation guidelines published by the [wwPDB SAS validation task force](https://www.wwpdb.org/task/sas) [(Trewhella et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28876235/), crosslinking-MS [(Leitner et al., 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33065067/), and 3DEM [(Kleywegt et al., 2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38358351/) communities.

Validation of models built using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is under development and will be included in subsequent versions of the validation report.
