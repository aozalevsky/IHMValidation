  <div><i>
    Regions of <b>low</b> {% include "prism_palette.j2" %} <b>high</b> precision, defined as the variability among the models that satisfy the input data and calculated as the density-weighted root mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) from the bead/atom center of density, annotated and visualized using PrISM. 
    The per-bead precision is computed from the deposited ensemble of superposed integrative models. 
    High- and low-precision regions are then determined by clustering beads of similar precision based on their proximity in the structure.
    Only coarse-grained beads (or CA atoms for atomic models) of deposited models are used for assessment and visualization, and three projections for each representative model are generated.
