    Regions of <b>low</b> {% include "prism_palette.j2" %} <b>high</b> precision annotated and visualized using PrISM. 
    The per-bead or per-residue precision is computed from the deposited ensemble of superposed integrative models. 
    High- and low-precision regions are then determined by clustering beads of similar precision based on their proximity in the structure.
    Only coarse-grained beads and CA atoms of deposited models are used for asessement and visualization, and three projections for each representative model are generated.
